      <div class="paraone"> <p>Nasty Gal is an American-based and owned online retailer which specializes in fashion clothing, shoes, and accessories for young women. Founded by Sophia Amoruso in 2006, Nasty Gal was named “Fastest Growing Retailer” in 2012 by INC Magazine.</p> </div>

        <p class ="dropcap">Sophia Amoruso is the founder and CEO of Nasty Gal, a business she launched in 2006 at the age of 22, in the basement of her aunt’s home. In only seven years, Amoruso has grown Nasty Gal from a simple eBay store reselling vintage finds into an online retail empire selling sexy, retro-inspired looks at reasonable prices.</p>

        <p>From 2008 to 2011, sales rocketed 10,160 percent, making Nasty Gal one of the fastest-growing retail companies ever. In 2012, the company reported revenues of over $100 million, raised $49 million from venture capital firm Index Ventures — an early investor in Asos and Net-a-Porter — and leased a 500,000-square-foot fulfillment center.

          <blockquote>
        <p>Though I respect those that have the follow-through to do it, but I realized that college was more time than I wanted to invest. I want to and needed to get started doing something right away.<span>–Sophia Armoruso</span></p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>Amoruso’s rapid rise is often attibuted to the powerful social media connection she has built with her customer base of “bad-ass girls” on platforms like MySpace, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. "What led us to Nasty Gal was the fact that Sophia had created something extremely special in terms of a connection between what she was doing and her customer base," Danny Rimer, a partner at Index Ventures, told The Wall Street Journal.</p>

        <p>Alongside vintage finds and curated pieces from other brands, Nasty Gal (named after the song by funk musician Betty Davis, the second wife of Miles Davis) now sells its own in-house designs. "Designing was the natural next step for us. It's going on seven years for me that I've been selling clothing to the same awesome girl. And we've understood the kind of silhouettes and cuts that she likes over time," said Amoruso.</p>

     <h3>Sophias' Tips for Getting Ahead</h3>
     
     <ul>
       <li>Be open to cut work</li><summary>When I was 22, I wasn't too proud to do anything. I was taking out trash, buying stinky vintage clothes, and pulling gross Kleenex out of the pockets. I don't hire people who aren't willing to do heavy lifting.</summary>
         
        <li>Be educated by google</li><summary>I researched on YouTube what venture capital was, what VCs look for in entrepreneurs. Even if you can't afford tickets to big conferences or you're not a natural networker, there's so much information online for you to assimilate.</summary>
         
         <li>It's ok to reject advice</li><summary>Learn from other people's mistakes, but learn from your own, too. People told me I'd never outgrow our warehouse space. And I was like, "You watch." [Nasty Gal just opened a 500,000-square-foot fulfillment center in Kentucky.]</summary>
         
       <li>Even free spirits need a strategy</li><summary>The first couple of months after I launched Nasty Gal, I was making more money than I had ever made working crappy retail jobs. I was having fun. But there was also a lot of problem-solving. I still follow my nose, but you can't lead an organization with 300 employees and not have a plan. My job now is to institutionalize the magic.</summary> 
 
    <li>know that being the boss is stressful</li><summary>I started the business so I could be by myself, behind a computer. But I have 300 people who show up for work every morning. That's way more intense than dealing with a customer for 30 minutes. Nasty Gal has taught me about sharing and collaborating—sometimes the hard way. I guess the best part is also the most confusing: I can't quit and I can't be fired.</summary>
